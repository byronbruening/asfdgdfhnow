<p></p>



<p>With the way he has been scoring goal after goal, Arling Holland was expected to win all the Premier League individual awards this season. That is what is happening.</p>



<p>A few days ago, Holland became the best footballer of the year in the eyes of England&#8217;s Football Writers Association (FWA), that too with more than 80% of votes. Manchester City&#8217;s Norwegian striker won both the Premier League&#8217;s best player and best young player this season.</p>



<p>This is the first time in the history of the Premier League that a footballer has been named the best player and the best young player at the same time. Amazingly, Holland won both these awards in his debut season in the Premier League.</p>



<p>Holland has 36 goals in 35 matches so far this season in the Premier League. He has played a big role behind City&#8217;s league win, Holland is also one of the heroes of the Champions League and FA Cup finals.</p>



<p>He has 52 goals in 51 matches in all competitions. The 22-year-old striker has shared the credit for his achievements with his teammates, honored to win two awards in the same season. Thank you to everyone who voted for me. Winning these awards would not have been possible without my amazing teammates. I am thankful to all my coaches, coaching staff. Two more finals to go and we want to finish the season on a high note.&#8217;</p>



<p>This is the fifth time a Manchester City player has won the Premier League season. Vincent Kompany and Ruben Diaz won once before Holland, Kevin de Bruyne won twice.</p>



<p>The best young player award started from 2018-19 season. Liverpool&#8217;s Trent Alexander-Arnold won the first season, followed by Man City&#8217;s Phil Foden in the next two seasons. Then Holland.</p>



<p>In addition, Holland has already been nominated for the best player of the season of England&#8217;s Professional Footballers Association (PFA). It is very likely that this City striker is getting that award. Somewhat sure to win him the European Golden Shoe.</p>

<p>On a happy day for Bayern Munich, club legend Oliver Kahn received a bit of bad news. At the same time, Hasan Salihamidich also had to hear bad news. Bayern won the Bundesliga title for the 11th consecutive season after beating Cologne 2-1 in the last round of the Bundesliga today.</p>



<p>The Munich club announced the sacking of chief executive Kahn and sporting director Salihamidić shortly after the title win.</p>



<p>&#8220;You may have already heard about the decision we made with the club&#8217;s supervisory board,&#8221; Bayern president Herbert Heiner told the media in the mixed zone after winning the match against Cologne to retain the title.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="621" height="448" src="https://secure.sbam.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/esyry.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8"/></figure>



<p>Bayern entered the last round of the league behind Borussia Dortmund. They won the match against Cologne but could have lost the Bundesliga title after 10 consecutive seasons had Dortmund won against Mainz. And if Bayern lost, Dortmund would win the title even if they lost. And if Bayern had drawn, a 2–2 draw with Mainz would have been enough for Dortmund to win the title.</p>



<p>Playing with such an equation, Bayern went ahead in the 8th minute of the match. And Dortmund went 2-0 down 24 minutes into their match. In such a situation, Bayern goes to break. But even then Salhamidić did not have a smile on his face. Maybe he already knew his fate.</p>



<p>Colon equalized in the 81st minute. But in the 89th minute, Jamal Musiala&#8217;s goal gave Bayern a 2-1 win. Salihamidic lured Musiala from Chelsea after scoring a last-minute goal that won Bayern the title.</p>
