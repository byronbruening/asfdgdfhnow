<p>On a happy day for Bayern Munich, club legend Oliver Kahn received a bit of bad news. At the same time, Hasan Salihamidich also had to hear bad news. Bayern won the Bundesliga title for the 11th consecutive season after beating Cologne 2-1 in the last round of the Bundesliga today.</p>



<p>The Munich club announced the sacking of chief executive Kahn and sporting director Salihamidić shortly after the title win.</p>



<p>&#8220;You may have already heard about the decision we made with the club&#8217;s supervisory board,&#8221; Bayern president Herbert Heiner told the media in the mixed zone after winning the match against Cologne to retain the title.</p>

<p>Bayern entered the last round of the league behind Borussia Dortmund. They won the match against Cologne but could have lost the Bundesliga title after 10 consecutive seasons had Dortmund won against Mainz. And if Bayern lost, Dortmund would win the title even if they lost. And if Bayern had drawn, a 2–2 draw with Mainz would have been enough for Dortmund to win the title.</p>



<p>Playing with such an equation, Bayern went ahead in the 8th minute of the match. And Dortmund went 2-0 down 24 minutes into their match. In such a situation, Bayern goes to break. But even then Salhamidić did not have a smile on his face. Maybe he already knew his fate.</p>



<p>Colon equalized in the 81st minute. But in the 89th minute, Jamal Musiala&#8217;s goal gave Bayern a 2-1 win. Salihamidic lured Musiala from Chelsea after scoring a last-minute goal that won Bayern the title.</p>
