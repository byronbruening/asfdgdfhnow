They won the match against Cologne but could have lost the Bundesliga title after 10 consecutive seasons had Dortmund won against Mainz. And if Bayern lost, Dortmund would win the title even if they lost. And if Bayern had drawn, a 2\u20132 draw with Mainz would have been enough for Dortmund to win the title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playing with such an equation, Bayern went ahead in the 8th minute of the match. And Dortmund went 2-0 down 24 minutes into their match. In such a situation, Bayern goes to break. But even then Salhamidi\u0107 did not have a smile on his face. Maybe he already knew his fate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colon equalized in the 81st minute. But in the 89th minute, Jamal Musiala&#8217;s goal gave Bayern a 2-1 win. Salihamidic lured Musiala from Chelsea after scoring a last-minute goal that won Bayern the title.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On a happy day for Bayern Munich, club legend Oliver Kahn received a bit of bad news.
