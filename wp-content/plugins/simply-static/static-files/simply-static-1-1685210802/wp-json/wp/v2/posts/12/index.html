That is what is happening.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days ago, Holland became the best footballer of the year in the eyes of England&#8217;s Football Writers Association (FWA), that too with more than 80% of votes. Manchester City&#8217;s Norwegian striker won both the Premier League&#8217;s best player and best young player this season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first time in the history of the Premier League that a footballer has been named the best player and the best young player at the same time. Amazingly, Holland won both these awards in his debut season in the Premier League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holland has 36 goals in 35 matches so far this season in the Premier League. He has played a big role behind City&#8217;s league win, Holland is also one of the heroes of the Champions League and FA Cup finals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has 52 goals in 51 matches in all competitions. The 22-year-old striker has shared the credit for his achievements with his teammates, honored to win two awards in the same season. Thank you to everyone who voted for me. Winning these awards would not have been possible without my amazing teammates. I am thankful to all my coaches, coaching staff. Two more finals to go and we want to finish the season on a high note.&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the fifth time a Manchester City player has won the Premier League season. Vincent Kompany and Ruben Diaz won once before Holland, Kevin de Bruyne won twice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best young player award started from 2018-19 season. Liverpool&#8217;s Trent Alexander-Arnold won the first season, followed by Man City&#8217;s Phil Foden in the next two seasons. Then Holland.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Holland has already been nominated for the best player of the season of England&#8217;s Professional Footballers Association (PFA). It is very likely that this City striker is getting that award. Somewhat sure to win him the European Golden Shoe.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the way he has been scoring goal after goal, Arling Holland was expected to win all the Premier League individual awards this season.
